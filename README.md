# EnergyMonitor
The power consumption of our house is made available to a dashboard so I can keep an eye on its power usage and how much money we're spending.  It works by monitoring the LED flashes from the consumer unit and transmits to a listening server (Raspberry Pi).  The sensor is just a light sensitive resistor connected to an Arduino mini pro with a transmitter.
